<h1>Up by NXTMIKE and PRESTXN</h1>

<body>
<p>I fall in reverse, I'm done with the hurt <br>
Sometimes I feel like givin' up <br>
I'm free from the curse, I've been through the worst <br>
I know I'm just on my way up <br>
</p>
<p>Yeah, I've been tryna' stay up but sometimes feel like I'm in the dirt <br>
And I've been workin' so hard like I'm clockin' right back into work <br>
But it could be worse so I keep it holy all through the verse <br>
Seven days made the <a href = "https://science.nasa.gov/universe/"> universe </a> so tell me why I should worry first, like <br>
</p
<p><strong>
    I feel so close to <a href = "https://www.gotquestions.org/who-is-God.html"> You </a> (So close) <br>
You're making me brand new (Making me brand new) <br>
You came to my rеscue (And now) <by></by>
I'm just on my way up <br>

<p>On my way up,<br>
     On my way up <br>
    On my way up <br>
